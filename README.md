# steamcmd installer for linux
this script will automatically download and install steamcmd FOR LINUX and will let either automatically install a game of your choice or just update steam and end there
Plan: make the script put the user input before starting any work so the ycan abort without having to delete the steamcmd folder each time you abort.
this is my first script so be gentle,this script will download and install steamcmd automatically for you and will let you input your first game, if the script dont work do chmod 755 steamcmdinstaller3.0.sh
