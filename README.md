# steamcmd installer for linux
this linux script will automatically download and install steamcmd and will let either automatically install a game of your choice or just update steam and end there
Plan: make the script put the user input before starting any work so the ycan abort without having to delete the steamcmd folder each time you abort.
this is my first script so be gentle,this script will download and install steamcmd automatically for you and will let you input your first game, if the script dont work do chmod 755 steamcmdinstaller3.0.sh
# Current Features
32-64 bit architecture support(almost done!),
Install a game from the script after it installed steamcmd,
No need to touch a file manager, the script will handle everything from downloading to install steamcmd and optionally a game,
anonymous logging support,
the script can make automatically a user account in linux for steam without password(almost done!),
#planned feature
make it so the script dont install anything until the user inputted all the needed variable(0%complete,not sure i will implement it)
